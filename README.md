Project Goals

This project is a reimplementation of the Minecraft: Java Edition server in C#.
The primary goal is to simplify and modernize server development for Minecraft: Java Edition.

Phase 1 – Faithful Reimplementation

The first milestone is to reimplement the server as Mojang originally designed it.
This means most things will work in a similar questionable as in Java edition including it's horrible Threading choices.

Phase 2 – Modern Improvements

Once a faithful baseline has been established, the focus will shift to improving the architecture:

Modern threading and async patterns

Performance and scalability improvements

Easier maintainability and extensibility
